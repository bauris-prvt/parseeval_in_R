Analyzing articulatory data with

 ** ParseEval in R **
=================================

Browse the directories, the name should
give away what to expect.

- "documentation" holds the latex-source of
the documentation

- "examples" holds a couple of R scripts for
quick-starting, plotting, etc.

- "source" holds the code for the actual
R function
=================================

ToDo:

- function code overhaul
- tweaking output and overall functionality
